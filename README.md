# A-Loacl-AI-Chatbot-using-Python-Flask-ollama-LLM-and-langchain.
This project is a fully functional AI chatbot powered by Ollama’s local LLM, LangChain for context and prompt management, and a Flask backend for seamless web integration. It demonstrates how to run an intelligent conversational agent locally, ensuring data privacy, fast inference, and modular scalability. 


## Features

- Local LLM hosting (Ollama) — no external API calls required.
- Prompt / context management using **LangChain**.
- Simple REST API built with **Flask** for driving chat clients.
- Example client usage (curl / simple front-end).
- Extensible architecture (add retrieval, RAG, tool use, etc).
---

## Prerequisites

- A machine with enough resources to run the chosen local model (RAM/CPU/GPU as required by the model).  
- Python 3.9 or later.  
- Ollama installed (follow official Ollama docs for installation and model download).  
- Basic familiarity with Python and REST APIs.

> **Note:** Ollama install and model pulling instructions change over time. Please consult the official Ollama docs for your OS: **https://ollama.ai/docs** (or your preferred official source).
